<p>This package provides a selection of bounded containers modelled on
the Ada 2005 container libraries but with the intention of being usable
in "high integrity" software.</p>
<p>The containers are implemented without using access types, dynamic
memory allocation and/or exceptions.</p>
<p>They are distributed with a set of unit tests covering 100.0% of
the code.</p>
