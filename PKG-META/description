<p>
This package provides a selection of bounded containers modelled on
the Ada 2005 containers.</p>
<p>
The containers are implemented without using access types and dynamic
memory allocation in order to provide deterministic behaviour. The
containers also avoid the use of exceptions, in order to ease
static analysis and help manual auditing of program flow.</p>
<p>
The containers are distributed with a set of unit tests that are
shown to cover all possible code paths (100% coverage according to
various code coverage tools).</p>
<p>
Currently, the following packages are implemented:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>CGBC.Bounded_Stacks</li>
  <li>CGBC.Bounded_Hashed_Maps</li>
  <li>CGBC.Bounded_Generic_Strings</li>
  <li>CGBC.Bounded_Strings</li>
  <li>CGBC.Bounded_Wide_Strings</li>
  <li>CGBC.Bounded_Wide_Wide_Strings</li>
</ul>
</p>
